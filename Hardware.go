	This is the module wich interact with the hardware of the elevator.
	It runs as a separate goroutine wich continously 'pings' the hardware
	for new information. It contains a continous loop which querys the 
	hardware for status of the order buttons and the floor sensors.
	If it detects some new information, it calls the main module to handle it.
	It also contains an interface where the main module can call the hardware
	module to set the lights to indicate wether a floor is ordered or if the
	order is completed and to set the engine direction(which means it goes up,
	down or stops.).
	It contains two internal functions which are used to simplify the main
	loop. These functions check the button status' and floor status' 
	respectively.
